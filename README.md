#### This is the most recent, certifiable data available from the [EPA](https://www.epa.gov/air-emissions-inventories/air-pollutant-emissions-trends-data).
“But the Earth has always been heating up.” This is a popular argument. To an extent, it’s true. The climate has always been changing. But never in history have Earth-warming emissions been so radically high. Even the industrial revolution doesn’t begin to compare to present day emissions. The USA is the 2nd largest contributor to CO₂ emissions. Per person, we’re #1. So instead of blaming developing countries, we need to own up to our carbon pollution and the climate change it causes.
