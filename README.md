“But the Earth has always been heating up.” This is a popular argument. To an extent, it’s true. The climate has always been changing.

The USA is the 2nd largest contributor to CO₂ emissions. Per person, we’re #1. So instead of blaming developing countries, we need to own up to our carbon pollution and the climate change it causes.
